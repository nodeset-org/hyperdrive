hyperdrive (1.2.0~dev) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New config option under Hyperdrive and TX Fees: "TX Endpoint Mode" lets you decide how to submit transactions. Use your execution client and fallback client (by default), an alternate provider like Flashbots Protect that offers gas-free revert protection, or a custom RPC URL of your own. Note that this is still **experimental** - use with caution!
  * Fixed the URL used by Prysm for downloading the initial Holesky genesis state when setting it up for the first time.
  * Removed the Holesky Staging network option from the default list.

hyperdrive (1.1.1) stable; urgency=high

  * Updated Besu, Nethermind, Reth, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku, and Prometheus.
  * Switching networks in the `service config` network dropdown now properly loads the new network settings before starting the containers again.
  * Installing Hyperdrive updates via `apt update` now prompts you to automatically restart the service so the daemons will be up to date.
  * Installing manually via `hyperdrive service install` will now automatically restart the service unless the `--no-restart` flag is provided.
  * Fixed a bug that broke Constellation's automatic signed-exit upload task if an exit message was manually uploaded first via `cs minipool upload-signed-exit`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused Rocket Pool contract queries to hang on single-CPU systems.
  * New global flags: `--itsf` can be used to ignore TX simulation failues and sign / submit TXs anyway, even if they will revert. `--fgl` can force a specific gas limit on all transactions created by whatever command is being run. Do NOT use these unless you know what you're doing and have a good reason.
  * Added `--sbc` and `--slc` to `cs minipool create` which skip node balance and Constellation liquidity checks respectively. Only use this if you intend to sign (but not submit) a TX for manual bundling or submit at a later date when the on-chain conditions become correct.
  * The max fee selection prompt now properly shows the low and high transaction cost range, instead of just showing the high cost twice.
  * Running Constellation or StakeWise commands without the respective module enabled will now print a proper warning message instead of a connection error.
  * Removed delegate info from `cs minipool status` since it is not relevant for Constellation node operators.
  * The `service config` validation routine will now work properly if you don't have any of the default MEV-Boost relays enabled but do have your own custom relays.
  * Changing the contents of the MEV-Boost custom relay option will now properly flag the `mev_boost` container as needing to be restarted.
  * The default max fee has been reduced to 20, and the default max priority fee has been reduced to 0.1. Note this only affects new users that are configuring Hyperdrive for the first time.
  * Automatic TXs will now ignore the gas threshold setting if a manual max fee is specified, as the threshold setting is only useful for dynamic network-based fees.
  * Automatic TXs will now lower the max priority fee down to the max fee if the priority fee is greater than the max fee.
  * Added additional validation to `service config` so the above conditions should not normally be possible anyway.

hyperdrive (1.1.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Improved error handling on nodeset.io requests to provide more information on what's wrong.
  * Increased the task cooldown when the system is not ready yet to 15 seconds.
  * Fixed a bug that erroneously printed log warnings about validators with already-uploaded signed exits not being included when uploading a new signed exit.
  * Added `cs network stats` to view info about the Constellation settings and deposit pool status.
  * `cs minipool create` once again saves the validator pubkey before sending the TX.
  * Fixed the text on `cs minipool exit`.

  * Updated Besu, Geth, Nethermind, Reth, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku, Prometheus, and the Node Exporter.
  * Moved the nodeset.io client from the StakeWise module into the Hyperdrive daemon, so the old `stakewise nodeset register-node` and `stakewise nodeset registration-status` commands are now just `nodeset register-node` and `nodeset registration-status`.

hyperdrive (1.0.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Updated Nethermind, Reth, Nimbus, Prysm, Teku, Grafana, and Prometheus.
  * Community contributions: fixed both API key validation and the default machine name used with Beaconcha.in integration.
  * The timeout on the external IP query during `service` commands has been reduced to 3 seconds to remove excessive command delay.
  * The config wizard no longer requires entering the external MEV-Boost URL when using externally managed clients.
  * Fixed a typo in `wallet init` and `wallet recover` to reflect the correct command name (`register-node`).
  * Hyperdrive now creates the `metrics/modules` folder while deploying the Grafana and Prometheus configurations to ensure proper permissions are set.
  * Added a toggle for IPv6 support.
  * Added the `service down` command.
  * Moved the StakeWise Operator's database into its own Docker volume.
  * `stakewise` commands that encounter a client error during a sync check will now report the error instead of stating the clients are not synced.

hyperdrive (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Updated Besu, Geth, Reth, Lighthouse, Lodestar, and Teku.
  * Added support for Mainnet.
  * Fixed a race condition that caused `service start` to incorrectly state your node wasn't registered with your NodeSet account if the service was stopped before running the command.
  * The MEV-Boost relay selection mode has been adjusted in preparation for Mainnet.
  * Added support for Prometheus scrape targets provided by modules. 
  * Fixed a bug that prevented Lighthouse's VC from working with MEV-Boost enabled.
  * Improved the node registration check to handle NodeSet service connection failures and race conditions.
  * New command: `stakewise nodeset generate-deposit-data` can be used to print the deposit data for your validators directly instead of uploading it to the NodeSet servers, just in case you need to access it for any reason.
  * Updated the StakeWise v3 Operator container. This version no longer spams the logs with warning about empty deposit data or missing validator keys, which were not applicable to NodeSet operators.
  * Added support for 0xSplits v2.0, which is now used for StakeWise rewards on Holesky and will be used on Mainnet.
  * The StakeWise daemon's task loop now waits for your node to be registered before trying to perform any actions that require registration.
  * Uploading deposit data to NodeSet now requires both your Execution Client and Beacon Node to be synced.

hyperdrive (0.5.0~b1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Updated Besu, Nimbus, Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter.
  * Updated the StakeWise Operator service.
  * Added MEV-Boost support for Mainnet and Holesky.
  * Migrated to the new NodeSet service's new authentication / registration system. Users with the StakeWise module enabled must first whitelist the node address via the nodeset.io portal for their user account, then confirm ownership of the node via Hyperdrive.
  * New command: `stakewise nodeset registration-status` gets the node's registration status with the NodeSet service.
  * New command: `stakewise nodeset register-node` will register your node with your NodeSet user account if it's not already registered.

hyperdrive (0.4.2~b2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Updated Besu, Geth, and Lodestar.
  * Geth: added a setting to toggle archive mode support.
  * Reth: replaced the max peers setting with separate settings for max inbound and max outbound peers.
  * Reth: `jwtsecret` generation now works properly if you create a new node and select Reth as your first Execution Client.
  * Moved the API from Unix sockets to network sockets.
  * Added an `Additional Docker Networks` setting. Use this to give Hyperdrive's containers access to other Docker networks running on your machine, so it can use services running in those networks.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the API and tasks loop to hang if your clients weren't synced yet.
  * Commands that require synced clients now also verify that the clients are on the expected network (e.g., they will error out if you're attempting to use Mainnet clients when Hyperdrive is set to Holesky).
  * Removed the deprecated `monitor-net` from Prometheus, so metrics will now work properly if the Rocket Pool Smart Node is installed on the same machine as Hyperdrive.
  * New command: `wallet send` lets you send ETH or arbitrary tokens (by address) to other wallets.
  * New flag: `--http-trace-path` lets you enable extra debug info for HTTP requests, printing it to the CLI's debug log if `--debug` is set and saving it to the provided file.
  * New flag: `--api-address` lets you specify the endpoint for the Hyperdrive server to connect to. Useful if you want to connect to a different machine. Defaults to the local daemon running on your node.
  * Multiselect commands (such as `minipool distribute`) now support ranges as well as comma-separated options - e.g., things like `1-3,4,5,6-10` will now work.
  * Running a command with an unexpected number of arguments now properly prints the command's help text.
  * `wallet export` now prints the wallet's private key as a hex string properly.
  * Fixed the background color in the `hyperdrive service config` TUI not displaying properly in empty cells.
  * StakeWise: Uploading deposit data for generated keys will now be blocked if your node wallet doesn't have enough ETH in it to pay for the gas cost of the deposit transactions (0.01 ETH per key).
